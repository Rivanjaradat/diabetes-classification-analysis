## Overview 📝🧪🔍
This project is divided into two main parts:

### Part 1: Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering 🛠️📈🧹
- Clean and preprocess the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categories, and scaling numerical features.
- Engineer relevant features and reduce dimensionality to improve model performance.
- Train and evaluate a Random Forest model on the processed data.

### Part 2: Model Comparison 📊⚖️🤖
- Compare three classification models: Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP).
- Assess performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
- Evaluate the impact of preprocessing and hyperparameter tuning on model performance.


## Results 📈🔍📊
- Demonstrates the effect of preprocessing on model performance.
- Compares RF, SVM, and MLP classifiers based on accuracy, precision, and computational efficiency.
- Includes visualizations and insights in the final report. 📋📊📈
